# Week 8 Project 
###(Iversen_parentage)

I'm using data on the parentage of a small population of Alaskan sockeye salmon. 

The question explored: How does the length to depth body ratio of an offspring compare to its parents? Do larger than average L:D parents produce larger than average offspring?
