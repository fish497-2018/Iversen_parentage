###(Iversen_parentage)

I'm using data on the parentage of a small population of Alaskan sockeye salmon. 

The question explored: How does the length to depth body ratio of an offspring compare to its parents? Do larger than average L:D parents produce larger than average offspring?

###Plan of attack

Keep in mind that sexual dimorphism is a thing in salmon - males will be larger than females, on average

Create new columns of length:depth ratios for moms and dads and add to a renamed version of the data frame
